```

## 📱 How to Use & Test

### 1. Initialization (`/start`)
- Run `/start` in the bot.
- If it's your first time, you will be prompted to select a language: **🇺🇿 O'zbekcha**, **🇷🇺 Русский**, or **🇬🇧 English**.
- Selecting a language will register your account in MongoDB with **1 free trial essay credit**.

### 2. Utility Commands
- `/help` - Step-by-step instructions on how to submit essays and receive scores.
- `/commands` - Lists all available system commands.
- `/contact` - Displays support and contact information pointing to the admin user: `@identitynull`.
- `/profile` - Displays your current username, user ID, selected language, and remaining credits.

### 3. Essay Assessment Flow (`/check`)
1. Run `/check` or click **📝 Check Essay** on your menu keyboard.
2. **Phase 1 (The Question)**: The bot asks for the Essay Question/Prompt.
    - Type or copy-paste the text of the prompt.
    - Send an image of the prompt (the bot will use Gemini vision to read the prompt directly!).
    - Tap **⏩ Skip if question is in PDF/Doc** if the question is already in your essay file.
3. **Phase 2 (The Essay)**: The bot asks for the essay body.
    - Send it as copy-pasted text.
    - Upload a `.pdf` or `.docx` document file.
4. **Grading & Feedback**: An animated processing message is displayed. Once ready, the bot deducts 1 credit, resets your state to IDLE, and sends a highly detailed IELTS score sheet containing:
    - Overall estimated Band Score.
    - Separate scores (0.0–9.0) for *Task Response*, *Coherence & Cohesion*, *Lexical Resource*, and *Grammatical Range & Accuracy*.
    - Specific grammatical corrections, alternative vocabulary suggestions, and improvement tips.

*(Note: If GEMINI_API_KEY is set to 'mock', the bot generates a beautiful offline mock evaluation report immediately, making it easy to test without active API fees!)*

### 4. Premium Upgrade (Manual Payment Flow)
- If your credit balance falls to `0`, trying to start `/check` will block the flow and prompt you with:
    - Premium pricing lists (e.g. 5 checks for 25,000 UZS).
    - Payment instructions with card details.
- To upgrade:
    1. Transfer the money to the specified card.
    2. Reply directly to the payment details message by uploading a receipt screenshot.
    3. The bot forwards the receipt to the administrator (`@identitynull`) along with two inline actions: **[✅ Approve Payment]** and **[❌ Deny Payment]**.
    4. If the admin clicks **Approve**, the user receives **+5 essay credits** and a notification is sent in their chosen language.
    5. If the admin clicks **Deny**, the user is notified of the rejection.

## 🛡 Robustness & Production Features

*   **Multilingual Architecture:** Simple dictionary file (`translations.js`) that supports dynamically formatting string templates.
*   **State Machine Persistence:** User state is saved in MongoDB rather than Node.js memory. If the server crashes or restarts, users continue their essay grading flows exactly where they left off.
*   **Advanced Message Splitting:** Bypasses the Telegram 4096-character limit by splitting feedback reports cleanly at line breaks.
*   **Robust Markdown Fallback:** Prevents Telegram entity parsing errors from blocking delivery by falling back to plain text if Markdown format fails to compile.
*   **Auto Admin Discovery:** If `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` is left empty in `.env`, the bot automatically retrieves the chat ID of the user with the username `@identitynull` once they interact with the bot.
